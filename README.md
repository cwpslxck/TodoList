Source code of my todo app that you can write your things to do and save it via download button and post it on your story with your friends.

i write this app in Farsi language and i hope i can add english later. o(≧ 口 ≦)o

!! I DONT HAVE ANY PLAN TO RUN THIS WEBSITE YET !!

## How it works

I create this [React.js](https://react.dev) app with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) library as a part of my [Portfolio](https://github.com/cwpslxck/Portfolio)

App has as input that you can write your note
then by pressing plus button it add a "id" , "text" , "completed" as a Task to other Tasks.

id is a number just for identifing, text is a string that is what you type in that input.
and "complete" is a bool that if it was true it means note is Done.

By clicking on note it change complete to true & false.

By clicking on Delete button its remove the note from your list.

By clicking on Download button you can save a screenshot to your gallery as a .png file via [html-to-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image) react library.
